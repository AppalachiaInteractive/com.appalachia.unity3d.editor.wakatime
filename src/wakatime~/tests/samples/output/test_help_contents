Common interface for the WakaTime api.

optional arguments:

  --entity FILE         Absolute path to file for the heartbeat. Can also be a
                        url, domain or app when --entity-type is not file.
  --key API_KEY         Your wakatime api key; uses api_key from
                        ~/.wakatime.cfg by default.
  --write               When set, tells api this heartbeat was triggered from

  --plugin PLUGIN       Optional text editor plugin name and version for User-
                        Agent header.
  --time time           Optional floating-point unix epoch timestamp. Uses
                        current time by default.
  --lineno INT          Optional line number. This is the current line being
                        edited.
  --cursorpos INT       Optional cursor position in the current file.
  --entity-type ENTITY_TYPE
                        Entity type for this heartbeat. Can be "file",
                        "domain" or "app". Defaults to "file".
  --category CATEGORY   Category of this heartbeat activity. Can be "coding",
                        "building", "indexing", "debugging", "running tests",
                        "writing tests", "manual testing", "code reviewing",
                        "browsing", or "designing". Defaults to "coding".
  --proxy PROXY         Optional proxy configuration. Supports HTTPS and SOCKS
                        proxies. For example: https://user:pass@host:port or
                        socks5://user:pass@host:port or domain\user:pass
  --no-ssl-verify       Disables SSL certificate verification for HTTPS
                        requests. By default, SSL certificates are verified.
  --ssl-certs-file FILE
                        Override the bundled Python Requests CA certs file. By
                        default, uses certifi for ca certs.
  --project PROJECT     Optional project name.
  --alternate-project PROJECT
                        Optional alternate project name. Auto-discovered
                        project takes priority.
  --language LANGUAGE   Optional language name. If valid, takes priority over
                        auto-detected language.
  --local-file FILE     Absolute path to local file for the heartbeat. When
                        --entity is a remote file, this local file will be
                        used for stats and just the value of --entity sent
                        with heartbeat.
  --hostname HOSTNAME   Hostname of current machine.
  --disable-offline     Disables offline time logging instead of queuing
                        logged time.
  --hide-file-names     Obfuscate filenames. Will not send file names to api.
  --hide-project-names  Obfuscate project names. When a project folder is
                        detected instead of using the folder name as the
                        project, a .wakatime-project file is created with a
                        random project name.
  --hide-branch-names   Obfuscate branch names. Will not send revision control
                        branch names to api.
  --exclude PATH        Filename patterns to exclude from logging. POSIX regex
                        syntax. Can be used more than once.
  --exclude-unknown-project
                        When set, any activity where the project cannot be
                        detected will be ignored.
  --include PATH        Filename patterns to log. When used in combination
                        with --exclude, files matching include will still be
                        logged. POSIX regex syntax. Can be used more than
                        once.
  --include-only-with-project-file
                        Disables tracking folders unless they contain a
                        .wakatime-project file. Defaults to false.
  --extra-heartbeats    Reads extra heartbeats from STDIN as a JSON array
                        until EOF.
  --log-file FILE       Defaults to ~/.wakatime.log.
  --api-url URL         Heartbeats api url. For debugging with a local server.
  --timeout SECONDS     Number of seconds to wait when sending heartbeats to
                        api. Defaults to 60 seconds.
  --sync-offline-activity AMOUNT
                        Amount of offline activity to sync from your local
                        ~/.wakatime.db sqlite3 file to your WakaTime Dashboard
                        before exiting. Can be "none" or a positive integer
                        number. Defaults to 100, meaning for every heartbeat
                        sent while online, 100 offline heartbeats are synced.
                        Can be used without --entity to only sync offline
                        activity without generating new heartbeats.
  --today               Prints dashboard time for Today, then exits.
  --config FILE         Defaults to ~/.wakatime.cfg.
  --config-section SECTION
                        Optional config section when reading or writing a
                        config key. Defaults to [settings].
  --config-read KEY     Prints value for the given config key, then exits.
  --config-write KEY VALUE
                        Writes value to a config key, then exits. Expects two
                        arguments, key and value.
  --verbose             Turns on debug messages in log file.
  --version             show program's version number and exit
